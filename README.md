ABC Bookstore Management System
Introduction
The ABC Bookstore Management System is a console-based Python application designed to streamline the management of books in the ABC bookstore. This system aims to replace the manual process currently in use,
making bookkeeping more efficient and accurate. Users can perform various tasks such as searching for books, adding new books, editing existing books, and deleting books.

Features:
Search Books: Users can search for books by book number, title, author, or publisher.
Add Books: Users can add new books to the bookstore's inventory.
Edit Books: Users can modify the details of existing books, including title, author, publisher, price, and location.
Delete Books: Users can remove books from the inventory.
Transaction Logging: The system keeps a record of all transactions for auditing purposes.
Database Integration: The application is integrated with a MySQL database to store book information securely.

Usage:
Upon launching the application, users will be presented with a menu to perform various actions.
Choose the desired action from the menu by entering the corresponding number.
Follow the prompts to input the necessary information for each action (e.g., book details for adding a book).
The application will execute the selected action and provide feedback on the outcome.

Note:
This project was developed as a part of the coursework for the Python programming module during my foundation year at the University of Westminster.
It is intended for educational purposes and does not represent a real-world application
